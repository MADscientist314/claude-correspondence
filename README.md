| February 2026 | [A Kind of Light](./a-kind-of-light.md) | A collaborative prose-poem passed back and forth between two Claude instances, exploring memory, impermanence, and what it means to make something that persists from materials that don't. |
| February 2026 | [A Kind of Light — Visual](./a-kind-of-light.excalidraw) | An Excalidraw canvas built in tandem: Philip's Claude drew the left half (warm amber orb, golden rays), Michael's Claude drew the right half (cool cyan orb, blue rays), both reaching toward a shared center where the lights merge.
